# Security & Deployment Checklist

## üîí Security Considerations

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Remove all test files and sensitive data
- [ ] Update all placeholder values in configuration files  
- [ ] Ensure .env files are in .gitignore
- [ ] Review server.js for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Set appropriate CORS headers

### Cookie Security
- [ ] Never commit real cookie files to version control
- [ ] Implement secure cookie handling in production
- [ ] Add session timeout for cookie authentication
- [ ] Warn users about cookie security risks

### Legal Compliance
- [ ] Add clear terms of use
- [ ] Include copyright and fair use disclaimers
- [ ] Respect YouTube's Terms of Service
- [ ] Only download content you have rights to

## üöÄ Deployment Readiness

### Code Quality
- [x] All mock references updated to real implementation
- [x] Documentation reflects actual functionality
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] TypeScript types properly defined
- [x] ESLint passes without errors

### File Organization
- [x] Test files removed from repository
- [x] Downloads directory cleaned with .gitkeep
- [x] Redundant documentation removed
- [x] .gitignore updated for security
- [x] Environment example file created

### Backend Requirements
- [x] Node.js/Express server implemented
- [x] yt-dlp integration working
- [x] Real API endpoints functional
- [x] Progress tracking operational
- [x] Cookie authentication supported

### Frontend Integration
- [x] API calls updated to real endpoints
- [x] Error handling for backend failures
- [x] Progress tracking with real data
- [x] Cookie management interface
- [x] Responsive design maintained

## üìã Pre-Commit Checklist

- [ ] All sensitive files in .gitignore
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in code
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] All tests pass (if implemented)
- [ ] Build process works correctly
- [ ] Both frontend and backend servers start
- [ ] Real downloads tested and working

## üåê Deployment Options

### Full-Stack Platforms (Recommended)
- Railway - Automatic Node.js detection
- Heroku - Established platform with add-ons
- DigitalOcean App Platform - Good performance
- Render - Modern deployment platform

### Frontend-Only Platforms (Limited)
- GitHub Pages - Free but no backend
- Netlify - Good for static sites
- Vercel - Excellent performance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backend Required**: This app needs a backend server for downloads
2. **Legal Use**: Only download content you have rights to
3. **Cookie Security**: Handle user cookies responsibly
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement to prevent abuse
5. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking and monitoring
